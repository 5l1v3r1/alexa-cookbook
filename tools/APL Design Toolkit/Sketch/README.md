# Sketch Toolkit

## What’s included:
* **Alexa Design System Library:** Sketch libraries are a collection of components and styles, such as: list items, icons, colors, and typography to help build layouts and user experiences. The symbols and styles in the Alexa Design System library are all code-backed Alexa Responsive Layouts.
* **Alexa Design System Templates:** This file includes full-screen Alexa Responsive Layouts for supported viewport profiles that have been built using library components and styles. 
* **Amazon Typefaces:** The templates and library use the typeface Amazon Ember Display, which is also included.

## System Requirements
* [Sketch version 55.2 or higher](https://www.sketch.com/)<br> **Note:** There is currently an issue with Sketch version 58 and our library. If you’ve updated already, the recommended workaround is to [downgrade back to Sketch version 57](https://www.sketch.com/updates/)
* [Anima Sketch plugin (free version)](https://www.animaapp.com/)
* [Alexa Design System layouts](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-cookbook/blob/master/tools/APL%20Design%20Toolkit/Sketch/Alexa-Design-System-Templates.sketch)
* [Amazon typeface folder](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-cookbook/tree/master/tools/APL%20Design%20Toolkit/Sketch/Amazon%20Typefaces)
* [Alexa Design System Library](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-cookbook/blob/master/tools/APL%20Design%20Toolkit/Sketch/Alexa-Design-System-Library.sketch) <br> **Note:** For automatic updates, download the Alexa Design System Sketch Plugin here:

```

## Installation Instructions
1. Install the Alexa Design System Library plugin. The library is updated automatically, so you’ll always have the most recent version.
2. Download the Alexa Design System Layouts and Amazon Typefaces files. The layouts file utilizes the library. You can either copy and paste art boards from the layouts file or save it as a template (but not as a new library). 
3. Install the Anima Sketch plugin. This helps simulate the responsive nature of APL and the layout files won’t work properly without it.
