# Installation Instructions

1. Download the Alexa Design System Layouts and Amazon Typefaces files from the links provided here in GitHub.
2. You can download the sketch files here with manual updates, or you get automatic updates by installing the Alexa Design System Library plugin at sketch://add-library/?url=https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ddg-apl-library/Alexa-Design-System-Library-appcast.xml. Pasting this link in your browser will automatically start the download for Sketch. Anytime the library is updated, you'll automatically be updated as well so youâ€™ll always have the most recent version.
3. The layouts file utilizes the library. You can either copy and paste artboards from the layouts file or save it as a template (but not a library).
